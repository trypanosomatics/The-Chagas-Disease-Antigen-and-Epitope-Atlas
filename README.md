# The-Chagas-Disease-Antigen-and-Epitope-Atlas
A Trypanosoma cruzi Antigen and Epitope Atlas: deep characterization of individual antibody specificities in human Chagas Disease patients across the Americas

This code allows you to replicate our main processing and analysis carried out in our paper. You will need the following:

* The files included in this repository
* The raw data files from CHAGASTOPE-v1 (such as *AR_PO_raw.tsv*) downloaded from Array Express [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11651/)
* The raw data files from CHAGASTOPE-v2 (such as *AR_E1_PO_raw.tsv*) downloaded from Array Express [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11655/)
* The design file for CHAGASTOPE-v1 (*Supplementary Table S09 - Mapping of CHAGASTOPE-v1 data to T cruzi proteins.tsv*), link found in our paper.
* The design file for CHAGASTOPE-v2 (*Supplementary Table S10 - Mapping of CHAGASTOPE-v2 data to T cruzi proteins.tsv*), link found in our paper.

Keep in mind that if you are just interested in the outputs and not in the process, you can find the corresponding Normalized Data in the same Array Express links, and the Smoothed Data and data per region as Supplementary Tables and Files in our paper.

Prefixes in the files and folders are there simply to indicate grouping and order. There are some missing numbers which doesn't mean anything.
